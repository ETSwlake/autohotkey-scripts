# autohotkey-scripts
Some of my AutoHotKey scripts, since people keep asking. Meant as a learning tool for other developers. I removed some personal scripts, like a hotstring that prints my address.

Disclaimer: most of these scripts are pretty jank. There's no incentives to clean things up when I'm the only developer *and* user. Your AHK should be the same way. Embrace the jank.

**THIS IS V1, NOT V2.** I've migrated all my personal scripts to v2 (it's way better) but haven't updated this repo yet. Doing the work in another branch.
